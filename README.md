# The-Final-Homework-of-Angry-Bird-in-Racket
This is my final homework of computational physics. Our programming language is racket. My homework title is angry bird. It uses the classical physics like missile model, spring model, collision model. My homework simulates the emission, flight of the bird and the collision between the bird and the pig.
